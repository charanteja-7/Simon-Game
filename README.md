# Simon Game

Welcome to the **Simon Game**! This is a web-based implementation of the classic memory game, where players must replicate the sequences generated by the computer. The game increases in difficulty with each level as the sequences grow longer.

## Features
- **Dynamic game sequences**: The computer generates sequences that get progressively longer with each level.
- **Interactive user experience**: Players interact by clicking the correct sequence of colored boxes.
- **Audio effects**: Each box has a distinct sound.
- **Error feedback**: Players receive immediate feedback if they click the wrong sequence.
- **Game Over screen**: A `Game Over` message is displayed when the player loses, and the game can be restarted easily.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript**

## How to Play
1. Click the **Start** button to begin the game.
2. Watch the sequence generated by the computer.
3. Repeat the sequence by clicking the correct colored boxes in order.
4. If you repeat the sequence correctly, you advance to the next level, where the sequence gets longer.
5. If you make a mistake, the game ends, and a `Game Over` screen will appear.
